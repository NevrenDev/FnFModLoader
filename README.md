You could kinda customize the look by changing the background image and icon (I'll change the icon in the future)
I'll try adding an option to more customize the loader, but it'll take a while

## Source Code guide
Download the source code and use pyinstaller to compile it or just run the .py file
You need to install tkcolorpicker and pillow in order for the app to work properly (required for v1.2 and above)


## Install guide
1. Download the bin release
2. Unpack it anywhere you want


## Mod installation guide
1. Download mod from gamebanana or gamejolt
2. Drop the mod to 'mods' folder
- if the mod has .exe file then put the mod folder into 'mods' (has to be mods/modfolder/file.exe or it won't detect the mod as executable)
- if the mod does not have .exe file then put the folder into 'mods' (has to be mods/modfolder/modassets or it will break)
- side note: maybe in future releases I'll fix it, but for now you have to follow these steps for the mods to work properly
3. Launch the loader
4. Choose the mod you wanna play
5. Click 'Launch'
6. Have fun!
Side Note: while playing the mod, loader will not respond as it doesn't have function to launch multiple mods at once, also it could break with non-executable mods

## Opening Settings
1. Open Mod Loader
2. Press Left Alt
3. Click File
4. Click Test
